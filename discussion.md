# Discussion Response

### 1.What instructions will we need to properly interact with your code?
I tried to build that UI like the following.
1. built sections separately as an independent components
2. built small components that will be used commonly for those sections
3. tried to update styles like the design
4. used svgs for the icons

### 2.Were there any decision points you came across? Did you need to make any assumptions?
In this challenge, I only concentrated on building the UI like the design as possible as I can.
I assumed the data for the API parts are completed ready to continue for me without any further data works.

### 3.Were there any questions you would have asked if this was a real-world scenario?


### 4.How did you prioritize your time? If given a few more hours to improve this, what you would work on next and why?
1. Built common components first
2. Tried implement them to the exising sections
3. Tried to integrate APIs

### 5.If you have any feedback or reflections, please share them with us. For example, if you could redo these exercises, what would you have done differently?
I will use a different UI package if I can try this again.
I only tried the original RN elements but by using the other UI elements such as material design, ant design things like that, we can build the elements more effectively.
